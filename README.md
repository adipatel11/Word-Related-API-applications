# Word-Related-API-applications
Programs that Make API Calls to Grab Random Words and Utilize Them

## Understanding this Repository
Both projects utilize a total of three API's that deal with words and their meanings. The game project essentially
generates a random word and then allows the user to guess the word based on generated synonyms. The word of the day
program contains three functions. One generates a random word, another grabs the word's definiton, and the last one
creates a "word of the day" message with both of these elements.
